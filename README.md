# Sustainable AI
A comprehensive repository to explore resources aimed at reducing the cost and environmental footprint of AI systems.

## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to solve many global challenges, but its environmental impact cannot be overlooked. This repository is designed to help AI practitioners and researchers adopt sustainable practices throughout the AI development lifecycle. By implementing energy-efficient models, carbon-aware algorithms, and eco-friendly tools, we can reduce the carbon footprint and energy consumption of AI systems.

**Contributions and pull requests are welcome!**

## Measuring & Quantifying Environmental Footprint
These tools are designed to measure and quantify energy usage, carbon emissions, and other environmental impacts of AI workloads.

#### Dev Tools
- **[AIPowerMeter](https://greenai-uppa.github.io/AIPowerMeter/)** – A library that enables monitoring energy usage of machine learning programs, using RAPL for the CPU and nvidia-smi for the GPU.
- **[CodeCarbon](https://codecarbon.io/)** – Estimates the carbon footprint during the training of machine learning models.
- **[EnergyMeter](https://github.com/maufadel/EnergyMeter)** – A Python module combining pyRAPL, NVIDIA-SMI, and eBPF to estimate energy consumption of CPU, memory, GPU, and storage on Linux with only three lines of code.     
- **[pyJoules](https://github.com/powerapi-ng/pyJoules)** – A Python library that uses hardware measurement tools (Intel RAPL, NVIDIA GPU tools, etc.) to measure device energy consumption.
- **[EcoLogits](https://ecologits.ai/latest/)** – EcoLogits tracks the energy consumption and environmental impacts of using generative AI models through APIs.
- **[RouteLLM](https://github.com/lm-sys/RouteLLM)** – RouteLLM is a framework for serving and evaluating LLM routers. Drop-in replacement for OpenAI's client (or launch an OpenAI-compatible server) to route simpler queries to cheaper models.
  
##### Online Calculators
- **[Green Algorithms](https://green-algorithms.org/)** – Provides an online calculator to estimate the carbon footprint of workloads.
- **[ML CO2 Impact](https://mlco2.github.io/impact/#compute)** – Provides an online calculator to estimate the carbon footprint of AI workloads.
- **[EcoLogits](https://huggingface.co/spaces/genai-impact/ecologits-calculator)** – Estimates the environmental impacts of LLM inference.
- **[AI Emissions Scenario Generator](https://borisruf.github.io/carbon-footprint-modeling-tool/ai-scenarios.html)** – Approximates carbon emissions by considering model architecture, the region where the model is deployed, and the expected usage (number of tokens).

#### Cloud Emission Dashboards
These dashboards provide insights into the carbon footprint and energy usage of cloud workloads from major hyperscalers. The data is **not real-time** and is typically delayed, meaning it cannot be used for real-time actions or optimizations.

- **[AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-customer-carbon-footprint-tool/)** – Allows AWS customers to view their estimated carbon emissions associated with AWS cloud services.
- **[Azure Emissions Impact Dashboard](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sustainability/emissions-impact-dashboard)** – Helps Azure users estimate and monitor the carbon emissions of their Azure cloud workloads.
- **[Google Cloud Carbon Footprint Dashboard](https://cloud.google.com/carbon-footprint)** – Helps measure, report, and reduce cloud carbon emissions on Google Cloud.
